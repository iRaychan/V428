# V4.29.21 Upgrade

1. Start from a complete V4.29.20 installation.
2. Apply `supabase/migrations/20261022213000_v42921_keyhq_company_config.sql` and then `20261022213001_v42921_verify.sql`.
3. Deploy the updated `supabase/functions/keysuite-keyai` Edge Function. This is required for company-scoped KeyHQ enquiries.
4. Upload every file listed in `UPGRADE_FILE_MANIFEST_V42921.txt`, preserving paths.
5. Clear the old site/service-worker cache or reload twice, then confirm the login screen and KeyHQ both display V4.29.21.
6. Open KeyHQ as an authorized role and verify that demo content is labelled Demo, an empty connected inbox is labelled Connected with no enquiries, and live content contains only the signed-in company's records.

Do not skip the migration or Edge Function deployment. Existing KeySuite functions and V4.29.20 quotation data are preserved.
